Not Anonymous: You acknowledge that this information is associated with your Discord User ID and Username.

Public Visibility: Feedback posted in public channels on our Support Server may be visible to other users.

Algorithm Training: We use anonymized historical query data (e.g., which tickers are requested most often) to refine, update, and modify the R.I.C.H. (Razor's Intelligent Charting Heuristic) algorithm.
